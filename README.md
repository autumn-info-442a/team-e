Facilitating meaningful connections.

# Problem Statement

COVID-19, quarantine, online-schooling, and online work will forever shape the way students interact with others. Due to to the lack of social interaction, students are unable to make meaningful connections with others who have similar interests. Social interaction is a pivotal aspect of the college experience as according to Hurst, B., Wallace, R., & Nixon, S. B. (2013, it improves learning by enhancing knowledge of literacy, ciritcal thinking, and problem-solving skills. Finding other students with similar interests is a much larger challenge now than every before as students are quarantined and taking classes from behind a screen. How might we enable students to make meaningful connections with one another in a virtual environment?
