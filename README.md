INFO 442 Team Explore

Hello! We are Team Explore in INFO 442: Cooperative Software Development. This repo will be used to host the hard work of our team for the duration of this class.

Our team consists of four undergraduate students: Greyson Fields, Jayson Edwards, Rajoshi Chakravarti, and Andy Cahill.

Team roles are broken up as follows:
- Product Manager: Greyson Fields
- Designer: Jayson Edwards
- Developer: Rajoshi Chakravarti
- Developer: Andy Cahill

Mission Statement: Facilitating meaningful connections.

Problem Statement: COVID-19, quarantine, online-schooling, and online work will forever shape the way students interact with others. Students today are being forced to mingle through instant messengers and even meet cohorts of friends through video chat which can be exceptionally more difficult to make meaningful connections with one another. Social interaction is a pivotal part of the college experience, and finding others with similar interests as you is a much larger challenge now.
