# Team Explore

## Our Plan

### How will you coordinate your work?

Greyson, our PM, will be managing the remainder of the work for our project. He will be using Jira to track issues, updates, and sprints to ensure that the team is aware of roles and items that need to be completed. We will have ad hoc meeting whenever needed in addition to our two meetings a week during our scheduled meeting times. Greyson will prepare the agendas and distribute to the team beforehand to ensure the meeting goals are clear and discussion topics can be known and added to.

### What tools will you use to communicate?

We will use Discord to communicate, as well as the Jira for commenting on issues. We decided to use Discord over other methods such as Messenger or Slack as Discord is where the class is run and we already have groups setup. For Jira, we chose this tool as it’s widely used in industry and has powerful project management features that will allow us to stay on track, compared to Trello, GitHub, or Asana.
